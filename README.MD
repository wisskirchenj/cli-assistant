## Program description

CLI assistant is a Node.Js project.Quite often we have to use the command line. With it, we can run our code and manipulate files, that is, we can do everything that we did using the graphical interface. Sometimes we even use arguments and flags on the command line to achieve the desired effect. In this project, we create a CLI assistant to communicate with using command line arguments! This assistant will provide additional functionality!

Have fun!
